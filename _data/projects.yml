    Designed, implemented and administered an end to end Monitoring and Alerting system for custom business data.
    Added a bonus intelligence to the system by integrating it with JIRA to avoid spamming.
    This project involved various tools like Apache Kafka as streaming data source, Apache HBase as storage backend, OpenTSDB as Time series database,
    Bosun as Monitoring and alerting system, FASTAPI backend for public facing API Gateway, HAProxy as Load Balancer and Apache NiFi as
    data processing engine.

  summary: >- # This means to ignore newlines until the next attribute
    Developed a password-manager program that will periodically change linux user's password on all the edges to strengthen security on a disconnected linux servers environment.
    Also, developed and implemented a supporting web application where the current password will be visible.
    This system does not use any central database to manage passwords.
    It uses simple mathematical functions along with timestamps to generate passwords periodically.
